8. List and define the different types of licensing agreements
* *Open Source* means the software **may be distributed for a fee or free.** The source code is distributed with the software.
* *Closed Source* means the software **is not distributed with the source code.** The user is restricted from modifying the code.
    * *Freeware* is **free software without the source code available.**
    * *Shareware* is **free software on a trial basis without the source code available.**
* *Free Software* is **software distributed with the source code. The software can be free of charge or obtained by a fee.**
9.  What is Free Software? Define the 4 freedoms.
* **Freedom 0**: Use the software for any purpose.
